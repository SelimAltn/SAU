# Personal Introduction Website

## TC. Sakarya University

### Computer Engineering - Web Technologies Course

This project aims to create a personal website as part of the Web Technologies course, allowing me to introduce myself.

## Important Points

- **All information is real**: The details on this website belong to me. Except for team images, all pictures are personally owned.
- **Heritage Page**: The required heritage page has been merged with the city page, and a "My Team" page has been created instead.
- **My Interests**: The "My Interests" section is located under the Entertainment Corner tab on the Anime page. This page dynamically fetches anime data using an API.
