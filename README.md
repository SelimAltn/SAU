# ShapeDetect  

## Overview  
ShapeDetect is a Windows Forms application developed as an **assignment for the Object-Oriented Programming (NDP) course** at **Sakarya University, Computer Engineering Department**. This project focuses on detecting and visualizing geometric shape collisions in 2D and 3D environments.  

## Project Details  
This application allows users to select various geometric shapes, define their coordinates, and check for collisions. The collision detection algorithms work in real-time and provide immediate feedback through visual representation.  

**Supported Shapes:**  
- Point (2D & 3D)  
- Rectangle  
- Circle  
- Sphere  
- Cylinder  
- Rectangular Prism
